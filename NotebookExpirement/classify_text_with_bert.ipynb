Rectal examination revealed two large (2 cm and 1,8 cm), anterior, amelanocytic polyps, at 1 cm from the anal verge. The patient denied changes in bowel habits or other symptoms.\\nAn elective trans-anal polypectomy was performed. Histopathology showed malignant melanoma: Mixed histology \\u2013 Spindle and epithelioid cells; Thickness - 11 mm; 16 mitosis/mm2; positive margins. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity to PS100, CD117 and HMB45; and negativity to CAM 5.2, AE1/AE3, p63, CD34.\\nAfter a multidisciplinary team discussion, and due to the patient\\u2019s old age, it was decided to propose a second conservative approach: Wide local excision (WLE) (). This time a melanocytic nodule was observed at the same localization of the previous mass. Pathologic examination showed AMM with pure spindle cell histology; 3 mm thick; margins free from disease. A thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scan was performed: No signs of distant metastasis.\\nThe patient was sent to the National Cancer Center for follow up.\\nA year later the patient presented with loco regional recurrence - Anal mass and palpable inguinal nodes, without any constitutional symptoms; Underwent surgery once again: WLE and bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy. Pathology observed anal recurrence (free margins <1 mm) and lymph node metastasis (15 out of 35 lymph nodes).\\nThree months later, the follow-up PET-CT scan revealed a pulmonary metastasis at the right lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node involvement (). Due to disseminated disease and overall status, the patient did not undergo radio or chemotherapy.\\nFollow-up was performed every three months with clinical examination and imaging (PET-CT or CT scan). The patient died 32 months after the diagnosis, due to disease progression.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic, suddenly developed dysarthria and anisocoria with subsequent loss of consciousness. Without palpable pulses immediate bystander CPR was performed and the patient was transferred to our hospital. On the way CPR of the ventilated patient was continued with a mechanical resuscitation device (LUCAS 2, Physio-Control\\u2122). After 45 minutes of CPR for pulseless electrical activity spontaneous circulation returned as assessed by a palpable carotid pulse, however femoral pulses were absent, precluding cannulation for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V6 (). Fast-track echocardiography demonstrated severe dysfunction of the dilated right ventricle. Pericardial effusion and severe aortic regurgitation were absent. Medical history comprised an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Acute aortic dissection Stanford Type A, De Bakey I with involvement of the right coronary artery was suspected. As percutaneous MCS was not possible without femoral pulses and since Type-A-dissection would have prompted emergency surgery, the heart team decided for immediate computed tomography (CT), which showed no signs of Type A aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, intracerebral bleeding, or carotid stenosis, but severe ubiquitous aortic calcification. Main findings were as follows: a large ventricular septal rupture with classical radiological signs of acute myocardial infarction (), signs of severe backward failure with contrast agent being observed in hepatic veins, renal veins (), the portal vein and the inferior vena cava (), and thrombotic occlusion of the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery (). The latter was probably facilitated by massive left-to-right shunt and associated severe forward failure. Shortly after the CT scan the patient had to be resuscitated again, but due to futility with subtotal body ischemia without any option for MCS or emergent surgery resuscitation was terminated.\",\n          \"A previously well 15 year old male presented to the Emergency department at 1600 h, 4 hours after a seemingly minor blunt abdominal injury during a weekend soccer match. Initially following the impact of another player's knee to the abdomen, the adolescent rested out of the game for half an hour before returning to play the second half. Following the game, he returned home, tolerated an afternoon meal before the gradual onset of constant, dull, severe, non-radiating, generalised abdominal pain that was not exacerbated by movement. Due to family concerns, the patient presented to our Level I Tertiary referral trauma centre by own means. He was normotensive and not tachycardic. The patient had no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed a guarded abdomen. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) suggested a trace of free fluid in the sagittal pelvic image. The initial blood pathology was normal except for an elevation of amylase 410 units/l, lipase 771 units/l and white cell count 12.2 \\u00d7 109/l. He was admitted for observation and serial clinical and FAST assessments.\\nThe patient's symptoms failed to improve after 24 h observation, during which time he developed shoulder tip and central back pain. A repeat FAST 24 h post-admission again revealed possible trace free fluid in the sagittal pelvic images with new concerns regarding trace free fluid to the spleno-renal angle. A computed-tomography (CT) scan was performed with intravenous contrast. This revealed a transverse laceration through the neck of the pancreas with normal enhancement of the pancreas and no pancreatic duct dilatation () consistent with American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale (OIS) grade IV injury.

We did some radiography on your arm and found some fractures and dislocations in your right elbow and wrist.Patient Yes, you have a Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.Patient It means that you have a lateral dislocation of the radial head and a fracture of the proximal ulnar metaphysis, as well as fractures of the distal radius and ulna.Patient We tried to reduce the dislocation manually under nerve block, but it was difficult to maintain the reduction of the radial head. So, we had to perform open reduction and percutaneous procedures under general anesthesia.Patient We inserted a Kirschner wire from the olecranon into the ulnar diaphysis and fixed the fractured distal radius and ulna with Kirschner wires.Patient We put a long-arm cast on your arm with the elbow in 90\\u00b0 flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.Patient Two weeks after the surgery, we observed callus formation at the fractured bone, so we removed the cast and started range of motion exercises of the elbow and wrist.Patient At 6 weeks after the surgery, the bone union was achieved, so we removed the Kirschner wires.Patient At 3 months after the surgery, you have no pain, ROM limitation, or lateral instability in your elbow or wrist.Patient You're welcome.
