Can you tell me what symptoms you're experiencing?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, I've been having a fever, a dry cough, and dyspnea.\\n\\nDoctor: I see. You were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19, is that correct?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nDoctor: During your physical therapy, we encountered some difficulties. Can you tell me more about that?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, I had trouble with position changes and deep breathing. Every time I tried to change my position or take a deep breath, I would start coughing and it would make me really short of breath.\\n\\nDoctor: I understand. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed you to change positions very slowly and step-by-step, right?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It took about 30 minutes to change to the prone position.\\n\\nDoctor: And I see that this approach increased your oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\\n\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nDoctor: Good. We also had to adapt your breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about that?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, I was instructed to stop every deep breath before coughing and to hold my breath for better air distribution.\\n\\nDoctor: I see that you performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase your oxygen saturation.\\n\\nPatient: Yes, I did my best.\\n\\nDoctor: You also had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity, is that correct?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, I did. But with close monitoring and frequent breaks, I was able to perform low-level strength and walking exercises without any significant deoxygenation.\\n\\nDoctor: I see that your exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until your hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\\n\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nDoctor: Great. I'd like to keep monitoring your progress and see how you're doing. Can you keep me updated on any changes in your symptoms?\\n\\nPatient: Yes, of course, doctor.\\n\\nDoctor: Alright, let's keep in touch. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.\\n\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.\\n\\n\""

Rectal examination revealed two large (2 cm and 1,8 cm), anterior, amelanocytic polyps, at 1 cm from the anal verge. The patient denied changes in bowel habits or other symptoms.\\nAn elective trans-anal polypectomy was performed. Histopathology showed malignant melanoma: Mixed histology \\u2013 Spindle and epithelioid cells; Thickness - 11 mm; 16 mitosis/mm2; positive margins. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity to PS100, CD117 and HMB45; and negativity to CAM 5.2, AE1/AE3, p63, CD34.\\nAfter a multidisciplinary team discussion, and due to the patient\\u2019s old age, it was decided to propose a second conservative approach: Wide local excision (WLE) (). This time a melanocytic nodule was observed at the same localization of the previous mass. Pathologic examination showed AMM with pure spindle cell histology; 3 mm thick; margins free from disease. A thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scan was performed: No signs of distant metastasis.\\nThe patient was sent to the National Cancer Center for follow up.\\nA year later the patient presented with loco regional recurrence - Anal mass and palpable inguinal nodes, without any constitutional symptoms; Underwent surgery once again: WLE and bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy. Pathology observed anal recurrence (free margins <1 mm) and lymph node metastasis (15 out of 35 lymph nodes).\\nThree months later, the follow-up PET-CT scan revealed a pulmonary metastasis at the right lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node involvement (). Due to disseminated disease and overall status, the patient did not undergo radio or chemotherapy.\\nFollow-up was performed every three months with clinical examination and imaging (PET-CT or CT scan). The patient died 32 months after the diagnosis, due to disease progression.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic, suddenly developed dysarthria and anisocoria with subsequent loss of consciousness. Without palpable pulses immediate bystander CPR was performed and the patient was transferred to our hospital. On the way CPR of the ventilated patient was continued with a mechanical resuscitation device (LUCAS 2, Physio-Control\\u2122). After 45 minutes of CPR for pulseless electrical activity spontaneous circulation returned as assessed by a palpable carotid pulse, however femoral pulses were absent, precluding cannulation for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V6 (). Fast-track echocardiography demonstrated severe dysfunction of the dilated right ventricle. Pericardial effusion and severe aortic regurgitation were absent. Medical history comprised an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Acute aortic dissection Stanford Type A, De Bakey I with involvement of the right coronary artery was suspected. As percutaneous MCS was not possible without femoral pulses and since Type-A-dissection would have prompted emergency surgery, the heart team decided for immediate computed tomography (CT), which showed no signs of Type A aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, intracerebral bleeding, or carotid stenosis, but severe ubiquitous aortic calcification. Main findings were as follows: a large ventricular septal rupture with classical radiological signs of acute myocardial infarction (), signs of severe backward failure with contrast agent being observed in hepatic veins, renal veins (), the portal vein and the inferior vena cava (), and thrombotic occlusion of the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery (). The latter was probably facilitated by massive left-to-right shunt and associated severe forward failure. Shortly after the CT scan the patient had to be resuscitated again, but due to futility with subtotal body ischemia without any option for MCS or emergent surgery resuscitation was terminated.\",\n          \"A previously well 15 year old male presented to the Emergency department at 1600 h, 4 hours after a seemingly minor blunt abdominal injury during a weekend soccer match. Initially following the impact of another player's knee to the abdomen, the adolescent rested out of the game for half an hour before returning to play the second half. Following the game, he returned home, tolerated an afternoon meal before the gradual onset of constant, dull, severe, non-radiating, generalised abdominal pain that was not exacerbated by movement. Due to family concerns, the patient presented to our Level I Tertiary referral trauma centre by own means. He was normotensive and not tachycardic. The patient had no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed a guarded abdomen. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) suggested a trace of free fluid in the sagittal pelvic image. The initial blood pathology was normal except for an elevation of amylase 410 units/l, lipase 771 units/l and white cell count 12.2 \\u00d7 109/l. He was admitted for observation and serial clinical and FAST assessments.\\nThe patient's symptoms failed to improve after 24 h observation, during which time he developed shoulder tip and central back pain. A repeat FAST 24 h post-admission again revealed possible trace free fluid in the sagittal pelvic images with new concerns regarding trace free fluid to the spleno-renal angle. A computed-tomography (CT) scan was performed with intravenous contrast. This revealed a transverse laceration through the neck of the pancreas with normal enhancement of the pancreas and no pancreatic duct dilatation () consistent with American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale (OIS) grade IV injury.

The pathologic examination showed AMM with pure spindle cell histology, and it was 3 mm thick with margins free from disease.\\nPatient We also performed a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and there were no signs of distant metastasis.\\nPatient We sent you to the National Cancer Center for follow up.\\nPatient A year later, you presented with loco regional recurrence, an anal mass and palpable inguinal nodes.\\nPatient And you underwent surgery once again, a wide local excision and bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy.\\nPatient The pathology observed anal recurrence with free margins less than 1 mm, and lymph node metastasis in 15 out of 35 lymph nodes.\\nPatient The follow-up PET-CT scan showed a pulmonary metastasis at the right lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node involvement.\\nPatient Due to the disseminated disease and your overall status, we decided not to do radio or chemotherapy.\\nPatient We performed follow-up every three months with clinical examination and imaging, either a PET-CT or CT scan.\\nPatient I'm sorry to inform you that 32 months after the diagnosis, you passed away due to disease progression.\\nPatient's Family You're welcome. I'm very sorry for your loss.\\n\",\n          \"Hello, I am Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?\\n\\nPatient Hmm, I see. And then what happened?\\n\\nPatient Okay, and then what happened next?\\n\\nPatient I see. After 45 minutes of CPR, did you regain consciousness?\\n\\nPatient Okay, let me check the medical record. Yes, it says here that after 45 minutes of CPR for pulseless electrical activity, spontaneous circulation returned as assessed by a palpable carotid pulse, but femoral pulses were absent.\\n\\nPatient We performed an ECG and it showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V6. And we also did a fast-track echocardiography, which demonstrated severe dysfunction of the dilated right ventricle.\\n\\nPatient Yes, it is. And we also found that you have a medical history of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. So we suspected acute aortic dissection Stanford Type A, De Bakey I with involvement of the right coronary artery.\\n\\nPatient Since percutaneous MCS was not possible without femoral pulses and since Type-A-dissection would have prompted emergency surgery, the heart team decided for immediate computed tomography.\\n\\nPatient The CT showed no signs of Type A aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, intracerebral bleeding, or carotid stenosis, but severe ubiquitous aortic calcification. Our main findings were a large ventricular septal rupture with classical radiological signs of acute myocardial infarction, signs of severe backward failure with contrast agent being observed in hepatic veins, renal veins, the portal vein, and the inferior vena cava, and thrombotic occlusion of the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery.\\n\\nPatient It means that the thrombotic occlusion of the descending aorta was probably facilitated by massive left-to-right shunt and associated severe forward failure.\\n\\nPatient Unfortunately, shortly after the CT scan, you had to be resuscitated again. But due to futility with subtotal body ischemia without any option for MCS or emergent surgery, resuscitation was terminated.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Good afternoon! What brings you here today?\\nPatient I see. Can you tell me more about your pain?\\nPatient Hmm, okay. And did you have any medical history before this happened?\\nPatient Alright, let me check your physical examination. Hmm, it seems that your abdomen is guarded. And we did a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma, and it showed a trace of free fluid in the sagittal pelvic image.\\nPatient Also, your initial blood pathology was normal except for an elevation of amylase, lipase, and white cell count.\\nPatient It means that there might be some inflammation or injury in your pancreas. That's why we admitted you for observation and serial clinical and FAST assessments.\\nPatient And I'm sorry to tell you that your symptoms haven't improved after 24 hours of observation. You also developed shoulder tip and central back pain.\\nPatient Yes, and after another repeat FAST 24 hours after admission, we found possible trace of free fluid in the sagittal pelvic images and new concerns regarding trace free fluid to the spleno-renal angle.\\nPatient It means that there might be some fluid accumulation in your abdomen and near your spleen and kidney. That's why we decided to perform a CT scan with intravenous contrast.\\nPatient And the results showed a transverse laceration through the neck of your pancreas, which is consistent with grade IV injury according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Scale.\\nPatient Yes, it is. It means that your pancreas has been severely damaged. But the good news is that the pancreas has normal enhancement and there's no pancreatic duct dilatation.\\nPatient Additionally, there's a small volume of low-density intraperitoneal fluid, retroperitoneal stranding, omental contusion, and a small linear laceration of your posterior left kidney without peri-nephric collection, which is consistent with grade II injury.\\nPatient It means that there's some fluid and contusion in your abdomen and a small injury to your left kidney.\\nPatient We need to monitor your condition closely and see if your symptoms improve. You may need further treatment, such as surgery, if your condition worsens.\\nPatient\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
